        <div class="infoBox"><h3 style="font-size: 15px;">The "Creeper Virus" was created in 1971. Once a computer was infected, it displayed a short message to the user daring them to capture "the creeper". Created as an experiment, Creeper did not cause damage - but did foretell the future of malware with its quick spread through systems.</h3></div>
        <div class="infoBox"><h3 style="font-size: 16px;">Stuxnet is a malicious computer worm that some call the world's first cyberweapon. Stuxnet is a malicious computer worm that became infamous in its use to attack Iranian nuclear facilities. That attack made global news headlines in 2010 when it was first discovered.</h3></div>
        <div class="infoBox"><h3 style="font-size: 16px;">Cybercrimes are happening at all times, all around the world. With an average of 97 cyber crime victims per hour, this means there is a victim of cyber crime every 37 seconds. In addition, 2 internet users have had their data leaked every second in 2022.</h3></div>

        <h2 style="font-size: 25px;">Theoretically, malware has been around since the 1960s. Officially, though, malware began in the 1980s with simple viruses and spread as personal computing grew. In the 1990s, malware became more sophisticated, with worms, Trojans, and viruses spreading through email and the internet. By the 2000s, cybercriminals used malware for financial gain, introducing threats like spyware, adware, and ransomware. </h2>
